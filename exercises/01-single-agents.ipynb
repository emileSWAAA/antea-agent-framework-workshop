    "## Microsoft Agent Framework\n",
    "[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) is an open-source development kit for building AI agents and multi-agent workflows for .NET and Python. It brings together and extends ideas from [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) and [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) projects, combining their strengths while adding new capabilities.\n",
    "Built by the same teams, it is the unified foundation for building AI agents going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Framework offers two primary categories of capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [AI agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview#ai-agents): Individual agents that use LLMs to process user inputs, call tools and MCP servers to perform actions, and generate responses. Agents support model providers including Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, and Azure AI.\n",
    "- [Workflows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview#workflows): Graph-based workflows that connect multiple agents and functions to perform complex, multi-step tasks. Workflows support type-based routing, nesting, checkpointing, and request/response patterns for human-in-the-loop scenarios."
